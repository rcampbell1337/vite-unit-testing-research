# vite-unit-testing-research
Doing some research regarding unit testing with vite and figured i could atleast make a repo from it! 

A pretty dull return back to GitHub from me after a long hiatus, just want to do some research in preparation for work, permitting me to see what vitest and vite are capable of. Nothing super interesting most likely, just a bog standard application with a set of frontend unit tests to accompany them.

:shipit: i'm back :shipit:
